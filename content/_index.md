## Hello and Welcome!

I'm a researcher at Cardiff University in the [Centre for High Frequency Engineering](https://www.cardiff.ac.uk/research/explore/research-units/centre-for-high-frequency-engineering). My focus is on high efficiency RF power amplifiers for wireless communications.

Before returning to academia I worked at [Ettus Research](https://www.ettus.com) developing the hardware and drivers for Software Defined Radios. While there I began contributing to [GNU Radio](https://www.gnuradio.org) and now continue to volunteer as a project officer. I'm very interested in how SDR and Free and Open Source Software can make radios and wireless systems accessible to hobbyists and students.

When not working on engineering topics I play the fiddle, cycle, and bake. This site is subject to entropy and aging just as much as anything so I hope you find something of interest.
