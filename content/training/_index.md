I run workshops and direct training sessions covering Software Defined Radio, GNU Radio, Ettus Research/National Instruments USRP Radios, and the RFNoC FPGA Digital Signal Processing framework. These are conducted on-site for groups of 1-10 participants.

If you would like to arrange a workshop or have questions: [derek@bitstovolts.com](mailto:derek@bitstovolts.com)

Here is an example outline of an introductory level two day workshop.

### GNU Radio
#### Theory

* Introduction (Project, Motivation, License)
* GNU Radio overview
* GNU Radio Companion (GRC) overview
* Third-party modules
* Project release and development model
* Key project and community resources

#### Practical Usage

* Installation of the GNU Radio core
* Creation of simple simulations using GRC
* Input and output functionality (File reading/writing, network streaming)
* Graphical User Interface elements and creation
* Interfacing with hardware (receiving and transmitting)
* Overview of common DSP blocks (filters, resamplers, etc)
* Basics of analog and digital modulation
* Implementing simple custom DSP using Embedded Python blocks
* Creating an Out-Of-Tree module in Python and C++

### RF Network on Chip

* Ettus Research USRP hardware overview
* Universal Hardware Driver (UHD) overview
* Deep dive on the USRP X310 and UBX hardware
* Introduction to the RFNoC architecture
* Hands on demos configuring and using existing FPGA blocks
* Building custom FPGA blocks with Verilog
