I am currently working on high efficiency RF power amplifier design as a PhD researcher at Cardiff University's Centre for High Frequency Engineering. Due to this I am not accepting any contracts longer than a few days, or an average of half a day a week for longer contracts. 

## Workshops

I run workshops and direct training sessions covering Software Defined Radio, GNU Radio, Ettus Research/National Instruments USRP Radios, and the RFNoC FPGA Digital Signal Processing framework.
