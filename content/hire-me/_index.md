I am currently wrapping up a PhD on high efficiency RF power amplifier design at Cardiff University's Centre for High Frequency Engineering. Due to this I am not accepting any work at the moment. If you are looking for information about GNU Radio, workshops, or are looking for contractors please contact me and I'll do my best to connect you with people who are able to provid these services. 

## Workshops

I have run workshops and direct training sessions covering Software Defined Radio, GNU Radio, Ettus Research/National Instruments USRP Radios, and the RFNoC FPGA Digital Signal Processing framework.

## General Programming

At this time I am not accepting contracts for non-SDR or RF related work.
