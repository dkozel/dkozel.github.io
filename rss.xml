Being able to use $$\LaTeX$$ is a big feature for me so here&amp;rsquo;s the solution I&amp;rsquo;ve come up with so far. Credit certainly goes to &lt;a href="http://drz.ac/2013/01/03/blogging-with-math/">Dr Zac&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="http://www.idryman.org/blog/2012/03/10/writing-math-equations-on-octopress/">Felix&lt;/a> for their work getting Latex playing nice. I believe that Zac&amp;rsquo;s is the more correct solution given its use of the custom header file rather than modifying the default layout. However Felix has the fix for a bug in MathJax which otherwise turns the entire page white when viewing an equation&amp;rsquo;s source.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Project Bankruptcy</title><link>https://www.derekkozel.com/post/project-bankruptcy/</link><pubDate>Wed, 09 Jul 2014 01:37:26 +0100</pubDate><author>dkozel@bitstovolts.com (Derek Kozel)</author><guid>https://www.derekkozel.com/post/project-bankruptcy/</guid><description>&lt;p>Most engineers, and probably most people in general, will be familiar with how projects and tasks accumulate. Finishing university and moving three times in two months has pushed my todo list past the end of the page. I sat down today and wrote down everything I could think of that I wished, or was obliged, to accomplish in the next month and have to admit that some (many) of the project ideas that float through my head simply aren&amp;rsquo;t going to get done.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
