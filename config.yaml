# Mandatory $.Site Variables ---------------------------------------------
# Site variables are built-in to the Hugo application and can be accessed using
# the {{ $.Site.variablename }} template directive. 
#
# Every site needs these few: theme, baseURL, languageCode and title
# Name of the theme your Hugo site uses; leave this in place:
theme: "bulma-kiss"
baseURL: "https://www.derekkozel.com/"
languageCode: "en-us"
title: "Derek Kozel"
